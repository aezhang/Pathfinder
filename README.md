# Pathfinder
A simple pathfinding project to practice algorithms, java, and GUIs.



##How to use
Java 8 or later must be installed. After cloning this repo, type the command
`javac Pathfinder/Pathfinder.java` in the highest Pathfinder directory. Then type
`java Pathfinder.Pathfinder <WIDTH> <HEIGHT>`, where WIDTH and HEIGHT are the desired dimensions of the
grid containing the start, walls, and goal.

Feel free to draw walls, move the position of the start and goal, and when you are ready,
click the "Find Path" button. After this point, the shortest path between the start and the goal
will be continuously redrawn, even if walls are added or the start and goal moved.
Click "Clear" to reset the Board.

The start is green, the goal is red, walls are black, yellow is the shortest path, and pink
squares were searched before finding the shortest path.

Have fun!
